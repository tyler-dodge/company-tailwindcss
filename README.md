## Contributing

Contributions welcome, but forking preferred.
I plan to actively maintain this, but I will be prioritizing features that impact me first.

I'll look at most pull requests eventually, but there is no SLA on those being accepted.

Also, I will only respond to pull requests on a case by case basis.
I have no obligation to comment on, justify not accepting, or accept any given pull request.
Feel free to start a fork that has more support in that area.

If there's a great pull request that I'm slow on accepting, feel free to fork and rename the project.
